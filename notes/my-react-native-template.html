                    <p>I've been working with React Native for a while now. The projects have been applications mainly
                        for small businesses and entrepreneurs as a freelancer during this time. After a few of these, I
                        find myself using the same architecture again and again.</p>

                    <p>Laravel's framework principles, together with “Clean architecture” from Robert C. Martin, have
                        greatly influenced me. One of the core principles I follow is loose coupling. As I usually work
                        alone, it allows me to effortlessly substitute modules I've implemented for another one.</p>

                    <h1 id="Main files">Main files</h1>

                    <p>The most important files for me are the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code class='code-inline'>index.js</code>,
                        </li>
                        <li><code class='code-inline'>App.js</code>,
                        </li>
                        <li><code class='code-inline'>config.js</code>,
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These reside at the root of the project folder. I consider <code
                            class='code-inline'>index.js</code> as the loading logic. I rarely modify it from the
                        default that is generated when creating the project using <code
                            class='code-inline'>react-native-cli</code>. </p>

                    <p><code class='code-inline'>App.js</code> Is the super container. It is the starting point of the
                        application, and it is where I integrate any React Native library that deals with context, like
                        Theme, Navigation, and Redux. It is the only React files that depend on non-react modules.</p>

                    <p>I seldom use a config file. The rare cases I do is for holding constants in the business logic
                        that can be modified later, or as a common place for service configurations.</p>

                    <h1 id="Navigation">Navigation</h1>

                    <p><code class='code-inline'>react-navigation</code> library has been enough for my needs so far. I
                        usually configure it inside one file name <code class='code-inline'>navigator.js</code>. It is
                        the interface between the screens and the main App component. It does not handle navigation
                        logic, just the configuration.</p>

                    <h1 id="Screens">Screens</h1>

                    <p>I'm a big fan of the functional paradigm. Now I'm using functions for every React components I
                        write. I think it is better for handling side effect from a readability standpoint. My preferred
                        method is using files directly like <code class='code-inline'>Screen.js</code> instead of <code
                            class='code-inline'>Screen/index.js</code> I've seen people do. I add styling at the end of
                        the file, and I use flow for specifying the type of the props. </p>

                    <p>Screens are the main containers or smart components. That is where I write business logic and
                        side effect code (like asynchronous code that deals with services). The components are the one
                        dealing with the UI.</p>

                    <h1 id="Components">Components</h1>

                    <p>The majority the components are dumb. They display data or accept input from the user and hand
                        out the result to the main container. They follow the same template as screens. I mainly write
                        components in the same file that contains the screen that will use them (Row in a list). But I
                        put reusable ones under the <code class='code-inline'>components</code> subfolder of the
                        project.</p>

                    <h1 id="Services">Services</h1>
                    <p>Services are for everything that interacts with the outside world. REST API, Baas, Persistent
                        Storage, … all fall under that category. The key is to decouple the service from the main code.
                        Apart from these files, there shouldn't be any mention of the services anywhere else — except
                        <code class='code-inline'>config.js</code>. They will contains the configuration logic that will
                        be inside the file and a collection of functions to use elsewhere.</p>

                    <h1 id="Utility functions">Utility functions</h1>
                    <p>These are small functions that contains logic you find yourself reusing throughout the app.
                        Things like concatenating the first name and last name of the user, formatting strings,
                        calculating various values... I just group them by category (<code
                            class='code-inline'>user.js</code>, <code class='code-inline'>format.js</code>) and put them
                        inside a <code class='code-inline'>util</code> folder.</p>

                    <h1 id="State Management">State Management</h1>
                    <p>This is an optional one. I mainly use Redux for caching API responses. It permits me to go from
                        an asynchronous paradigm to a reactive one. I found myself not using it with Firebase and Apollo
                        GraphQL, as the latter ones have their caching mechanism. When I do use Redux, I use the <code
                            class='code-inline'>rematch</code> library as it eliminates the usual boilerplate.</p>

                    <h1 id="Utility Libraries">Utility Libraries</h1>
                    <p>The most notable examples are theming and localization libraries. They do not deal with the
                        outside world but are important enough to not be relegated to the <code
                            class='code-inline'>util</code> folder. They are commonly stored alongside <code
                            class='code-inline'>App.js</code> as they will be integrated in it.</p>

                    <p>I did not bother setting up a repository for this. I predicted it will be the same amount of work
                        as the components will likely change, and I will need to update the dependencies. This is a
                        guideline that I follow to reduce the time spent on where I put each type of logic and focus on
                        writing it.</p>
