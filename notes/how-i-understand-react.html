                    <p>Every time I learn a new language, library or framework, I like to form a mental image of how it
                        works and why it works that way. It helps tremendously with being able to provide practical
                        solutions to business problems if you can discern their pros and cons easily. </p>

                    <p>I don't learn the technical aspects by heart. You will retain them overtime by practicing
                        regularly with the tool. Instead, I focus on the architectural level and I try to understand how
                        everything fits together.</p>

                    <p>As for React, I think there are three major aspects that one needs to understand well to be
                        proficient with it. They are the virtual DOM, the components and the component's lifecycle.</p>

                    <h1 id="The virtual DOM">The virtual DOM</h1>
                    <p>The DOM represents a document with a logical tree structure. Almost every UI library is
                        represented with a tree structure because it helps with geometrical transformations and property
                        inheritance. React's virtual DOM is a copy of that structure. Because modifying the real DOM is
                        costly (Computing the new UI representation takes time), React executes the manipulation first
                        on its copy, then compare the new and the old versions to determine the most performance
                        effective way to update the real dom.</p>

                    <p>That means that what you are writing and updating is not the real dom. It does not have the same
                        properties and you should not treat it the same way. That also means that the React philosophy
                        is also universal as the DOM in the browser is very similar in representation to the UI library
                        in other platforms (Which explains React Native). It is still a tree structure but with new
                        types of nodes. Here is <a
                            href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-virtual-dom-explained/">a post</a> that
                        explains the virtual DOM in more detail.</p>

                    <h1 id="The components">The components</h1>
                    <p>The components are each responsible for a section of the virtual DOM, which may contain other
                        components. There are two types of components: classes, and functions. I like the latter as it's
                        often easier to manipulate. With hooks, you can use a function instead of a class as I do now.
                    </p>

                    <p>As a developer, what you will be doing is create a tree of components that will include your owns
                        and those provided by libraries. These components will accept props as inputs and will return
                        the section of the tree they are responsible for. There are special components called HOC
                        (Higher Order Components) which are functions that will return either your component with new
                        additional props or a completely new component which will include your component as a child.</p>

                    <h1 id="The component lifecycle">The component lifecycle</h1>
                    <p>So where does the business logic fits? In the case of a class component, there are various stages
                        and React.Component class provides you with methods that will be called at each one of the
                        stages. You choose the correct stage based on what you want to do. Some are called only once
                        upon the creation (mounting) and the destruction (unmounting) of your component, other will be
                        called many times when your component updates (triggered by a lot of things). Here is a <a
                            href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/javascript/react-lifecycle-methods/">more detailed
                            explanation</a>.</p>

                    <p>Using functions make things cleaner. There is no more lifecycle to worry about. You are provided
                        with the props as parameters and you need to return the tree's section. That's it. Now with
                        hooks, you can do the same thing that the class component used to do. hooks are functions that
                        will accept arguments based on the current props and optionally will return objects that can be
                        used inside the functions. Those objects are not created inside the function scope so they won't
                        be destroyed when the function return. I think they get destroyed when the section of the
                        virtual DOM your component is responsible for is destroyed.</p>

                    <p>So that's it, that is my mental model of what React is. There are a lot of other things like the
                        relation between refs and real DOM, Babel, and JSX. But I think these three are the most
                        important concepts you need to wrap your head around.</p>
