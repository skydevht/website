# What I'm doing now

## Reading

I'm going through “Peopleware” by Timothy Lister and Tom DeMarco. The previous book before that was  “Practices of an Agile Developer” by Venkat Subramaniam and Andy Hunt.

## Learning

Learning 2 foreign languages at the same time: Spanish and German. The first is for travel, while the second is purely for the challenge.

My interest in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics has renewed. I've started working through “Introduction to the Theory of Computation” by Michael Sipser and “Types and Programming Languages” by Benjamin C. Pierce. For Mathematics, I plan to start with James Stewart's “Calculus” and “Linear Algebra” by Gilbert Strang.

I'm also currently in the process of learning some languages in the LISP family. I started with Clojure, but moved to Common Lisp. Furthermore, I plan to get back to Clojure, then continue on with the following:

* Go,
* Rust,
* Elixir,
* Haskell,
* Scala,
* F#,
* Forth.

## Work

I'm currently working with [Hyperproof](http://hyperproof.io) as a contracted developer.
