My name is Holy-Elie Scaide, but you can call me Hash. I am a software engineer working as a freelancer. 

I strongly believe that technology, specifically software systems, should be designed to enhance people's lives. As a professional, my aim is to develop user-friendly systems that seamlessly integrate with other tools to boost efficiency and productivity.

I aspire to keep learning and enjoy sharing knowledge through fruitful discussions. Outside of this, I enjoy learning music, drawing, and reading Fantasy and SF books.

I'm from Haiti and have lived here my entire life.
