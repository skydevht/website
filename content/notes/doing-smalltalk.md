Lately I’ve been interested in not so popular programming languages, like Common
Lisp, Forth, and Smalltalk. I’ve started programming in C and Python and have
never strayed away from the familiar syntax and concepts. I did encounter
[Pharo](https://pharo.org/) before that, but I lacked the motivation to explore
it. This was an occasion to revisit it.

Pharo looks more like a game engine like Unreal Engine 5 or Unity than the
standard IDE. You are not editing files inside a directory tree. You instead
have an image that contains the whole development environment. The surprising
thing is that you do not use the environment to produce an external artifact
(program or library). The image is supposed to be your program, you need to mold
it into your desired result.
