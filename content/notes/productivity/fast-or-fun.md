I have to complete a project and the most difficult decision was which technology stack to use. The design of the project doesn't favor one or the other; my knowledge of them is the only relevant factor.  The choice is either to use JavaScript or PHP with the benefits of my years of experience working with them, or to use a more exotic option like Clojure or Common Lisp. The first choice entails a dull development phase, while the latter will add the more motivational – at least for me – tinkering and learning aspect, but with a longer development process due to researching best practices and solving issues.

For now, I’m going with the fast option, as I just want the project done.
